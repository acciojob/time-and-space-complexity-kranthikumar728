    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity describes how efficient an algorithm is by measuring the time complexity required to execute a program as the input size increases.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm during execution, and it is often expressed using notations such as O(n).
